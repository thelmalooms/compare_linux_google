<p>Before you start writing and running your tests, you should set up your test
development environment. This lesson teaches you how to set up Android Studio to build and run 
tests, and how to build and run tests with the Gradle framework by using the command line
interface.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To help you get started, the lessons are
based on Android Studio. However, for your own test development, you
are free to use the IDE of your choice or the command-line.</p>

<h2 id="androidstudio">Set Up Android Studio for Testing</h2>
<p>Android Studio provides an integrated
development environment for you to create, build, and run Android application
test cases from a graphical user interface (GUI). A convenient feature that
Android Studio provides is the ability to auto-generate a new test package that
corresponds with your Android application project</a>.

<p>To set up your test environment in Android Studio:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html">Download and install Android Studio</a>, 
if you haven't installed it yet.</li>
<li>Import or create the Android application project that you want to test
against.</li>
<li>Android Studio automatically creates a default test package. To view the test package, 
in the Project tool window expand the directories 
<strong>app &gt; src &gt; androidTest &gt; java</strong>.</li>
   </ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to create, build, and run test
cases from Android Studio. To learn how to perform these tasks in
Android Studio, proceed to <a href="activity-basic-testing.html">Creating and Running 
a Test Case</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cmdline">Set Up the Command Line Interface for Testing</h2>
<p>If you are using Gradle version 1.6 or higher as your build environment, you
can build and run your Android application tests from the command line by using
the Gradle Wrapper. Make sure that in your {@code gradle.build} file, the
<a href={@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#min>minSdkVersion</a>
attribute in the {@code defaultConfig} section is set to 8 or higher. You can
refer to the sample {@code gradle.build} file that is
included in the download bundle for this training class.</p>
<p>To run your tests with the Gradle Wrapper:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Connect a physical Android device to your machine or launch the Android
Emulator.</li>
   <li>Run the following command from your project directory:
      <pre>./gradlew build connectedCheck</pre>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>To learn more about using Gradle for Android testing, see the
<a href="//tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Testing">Gradle Plugin User Guide</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about using command line tools other than Gradle for test
development, see
<a href="{@docRoot}tools/testing/testing_otheride.html">Testing from Other IDEs</a>.</p>
