<p class="caution">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Support for the Android Developer Tools (ADT) in Eclipse has ended,
  per our <a href=
  "http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/06/an-update-on-eclipse-android-developer.html"
  class="external-link">announcement</a>. You should migrate your app development projects to
  Android Studio as soon as possible. For more information on transitioning to Android Studio, see
  <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/migrate.html">Migrating from Eclipse ADT</a>.
</p>

  <p>Formerly the official IDE solution for Android development, Android Developer Tools (ADT)
  is a plugin for Eclipse that provides GUI-based access to many of the command-line SDK tools,
  along with a UI design tool for rapid prototyping, designing, and building of your app's
  user interface.</p>

  <p>As with ADT, support for the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/"
  class="external-link">Ant</a>
  tool for building from the command line has ended.
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/building/plugin-for-gradle.html">Gradle</a> is now the supported method
  of building Android apps.
